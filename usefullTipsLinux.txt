dbs can have conflicts when running on different collations ( locales ) :
1 enables this on your server machine by 
uncomment all necessary locales from :  /etc/locale.gen
in root generate them with locale-gen
now you have them in your machine!
// alternative use dpkg locales and select with space bar
2: in psql : use create collation "fr_FR" (LOCALE="fr_FR.utf8"); anotation not `` or ''
